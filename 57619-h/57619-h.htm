<h2><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Lest I be misunderstood in calling
this wonderful little animal man&rsquo;s
best friend among the furry creatures of
the wood, let me at the outset draw attention
to the fact that, far from putting
a bounty on its destruction as some
people might think desirable, many
states have laws protecting it, as much
for its usefulness to the farmers as for
the value of its very beautiful fur.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>The large black and white striped
skunks we or our pet dogs often encounter,
sometimes to our disaster, belong
only in North America. Our friend
Striped Coat was one of these. In the
southern and western states lives also a
little cousin of his&mdash;the spotted skunk&mdash;whose
fur though attractive is not so
valuable; but neither he nor the broad-striped
skunk of Central and South
America enter the pages of this story,
for Striped Coat lived his life farther
north than the range of either.</p>
<p>All of the skunk family still seem to
be considered unpleasant and almost unmentionable
creatures merely because of
their ability to throw in self-defence a
liquid, in the form of a spray, possessing
anything but the fragrance of roses.
Admitting that the odor is indescribably
awful and that to get it on one&rsquo;s clothing
is anything but a reason for joy, it
may still be claimed that the skunk himself
is by no means a &ldquo;smelly&rdquo; animal
and that his recourse to this means of
defending his life is quite permissible as
proved by our own methods of warfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>In the ocean the otherwise defenceless
little squid, when attacked, throws out
a dark liquid which spreads in the water
and either blinds its pursuer momentarily
or so confuses his vision that the
active squid has time to escape. It is
the same thing in the case of the skunk.
Let a fierce dog rush at him, and when a
show of his little teeth and a brave
stand have failed to save the poor fellow,
deny him if you can the right to use
as a last resort this stinging, pungent
musk which, properly aimed at the eyes
of his big enemy will have just enough
effect to allow him a safe and bloodless
retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>I do not doubt that there are many
skunks who have never had occasion to
pollute the air in this way. Several
have lived for years in drains around my
country home, and because my dogs are
tied at night, have only twice made their
presence known by throwing musk&mdash;once
when one of their number was run
over by an automobile and once when
some kind of a fight occurred among the
animals feeding together at night
around the garbage barrel.</p>
<p>That they have done me great service
in killing rats, field mice, beetles and
grubs, is only too evident. On all sides
are small holes in the earth and otherwise
unobtrusive signs of their diligence
in my behalf. They are my friends and
I am theirs. To me no other pretty
creature of the woods is more interesting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>In the past the skunk has been badly
treated by authors. It was so easy to
take a humorous but barbed fling at the
poor wood pussy! But that day is past,
for facts will out and our debt of gratitude
is too great longer to be ignored.
If my own words in tracing a part of the
life history of Striped Coat, prove at all
illuminating, I shall be happy. I have
come across several skunks of his peculiar
marking; one of them, partly tamed,
is shown in the illustrations; but the
story itself is largely fictional though
following throughout the habits and
true characteristics of these wild little
friends of man. Belonging as they do
to the elusive weasel tribe and being
largely nocturnal in their habits, to
chronicle all the actual happenings in
the natural, wild life of one of them
would seem an impossible task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Including this little creature in my
wild animal series is somewhat contrary
to the advice of my publishers who naturally
believe in &ldquo;best sellers&rdquo; rather
than in &ldquo;best smellers,&rdquo; but I have a
fond hope that Striped Coat will win his
way with readers to a place beside Bun,
Red Ben, Gray Squirrel and those to follow.
I might add that a young skunk
readily becomes a very tame, unusually
interesting and beautiful pet, a safe one
however only if accidents are provided
against by &ldquo;disarming,&rdquo; that is, by the
removal of the two scent sacs.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WOOD PUSSY&rsquo;S JOURNEY</span></h2>
<p>The full moon was shining over the
narrow waters of Goose Creek.
Here and there, its light slipped between
the seemingly endless branches
of the cedars, pines and oaks, and lay in
silvery patches on the sand along the
banks and on the carpet of dead leaves
which extended from either side of the
stream on and on, into the big silent
woods. Wherever the light could not
pierce the foliage, there were black
shadows in streaks and squares and
checker board patterns&mdash;black on white,
white on black&mdash;just two colors all
through the quiet woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>But presently one of these patterns
seemed to move. The keen round eyes
of Screech Owl who was perching on a
dead limb overhead, soon made out the
form of an animal, about the size of a
small cat, moving quietly along the
woods path; but even Screech Owl had
to look very hard, for this little animal
was all black and white itself and therefore
like a part of the woods carpet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Along the path it ambled until another
animal about the same size but
gray in color appeared from the opposite
direction. Then the little black
and white one slowed down to a walk
until the other, a &rsquo;possum, had passed,
but it might have been noted that it was
the &rsquo;possum which moved out of the
path. When, a little further on, a
larger animal, Gray Fox, came trotting
through the shadows and not seeing the
black and white one, nearly bumped
into it, the haste with which Gray Fox
leaped aside to make the way clear was
almost comical. Since both Possum
and Gray Fox felt such respect for the
little black and white animal it was
very evident that there was something
most important or formidable about it.</p>
<p>This same feeling was even shared by
two big does who with their young
fawns close at heel were walking to the
creek to drink. With snorts of surprise
and of warning to their tender charges,
they stood in the path for an instant, at
bay, the young ones peeping with wide
spread ears from behind their flanks.
But the black and white animal, acknowledging
the right of every woods
mother to protect her young, stopped
just long enough to allow the deer to
see who it was and gracefully to step
out of the way. Then on it ambled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Two old coons shuffled out of the
path without any hesitation, so did
the mate of Gray Fox&mdash;all feared to
come to close quarters with a full grown
wood pussy; but a mother mink who was
hungry and in a bad temper anyway,
halted directly in the center of the wood
pussy&rsquo;s trail and curled back her lips in
an evil snarl which showed every tooth
in her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>The skunk, taken by surprise, slowed
down to a walk, her long fur bristling
just a little and her bright, beady little
eyes and sharp nose trying their best to
search out some reason for this menace.
She had often passed the slim-bodied
mink at a distance, and knew her well as
one of the woods creatures that belonged
in that part of the wood. Surely the
mink recognized her.</p>
<p>With bushy tail raised well over her
back and every muscle ready to meet an
attack the skunk sidled cautiously forward.
She was not afraid, but she was
good natured and hated a fuss. Nearer
she came, then suddenly stamped a front
foot so fiercely and with such a show of
anger that the mink instinctively drew
back. Past her then grandly sailed the
skunk in the very center of the path, all
fluffed up like a ship under full sail. If
she saw the furious gleam in the mink&rsquo;s
eyes she did not show it, but went on
about her business as unconcernedly as
before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>It was to be sure, the custom among
the little wild things not to interfere
with anyone in the woods unless he was
a playmate or unless he looked good to
eat. The little gnawing tribe of grass
and nut eaters, the mice, the squirrels,
the rabbits and their kind nearly always
looked like a good meal to meat eaters
such as the fox, skunk, mink, owl, &rsquo;possum,
&rsquo;coon and cat. Therefore the
little nut and grass eaters always had to
be careful to keep entirely out of the
way of the killers; otherwise they were
seen no more. But a mink would not
care to eat an old skunk unless starvation
stared him in the face, nor would he
go outside of the mink family in search
of a playmate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>These, however, were strange, exciting
days for the woods folk. It was
spring time and nearly all of them were
hunting mates or, like the mother mink,
taking care of families of hungry little
ones. Only the wood pussy seemed all
alone and unhurried as she travelled
steadily through the moonlight.</p>
<p>Before very long, the path she followed
ended in a fenced clearing. This
was new to her, so she proceeded cautiously,
with many stops to test the night
air through her keen nose. Strange
things had happened since she had been
there before. Trees had been cut down
and dragged into heaps; a house and a
barn had been built; and worst of all
for the wood pussy, the hollow stump for
which she had headed so confidently all
this time, was uprooted and gone from
its old place. Now she too grew worried
and ran this way and that hunting
for this cozy, safe den which, during the
Spring before, had been her home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Well she remembered where it had
stood, among beds of sweet fern and
blackberry bushes, now all plowed under
or, if their ends did stick up from the
furrows, reeking with the smell of man
and of his constant companion the dog.</p>
<p>As the poor wood pussy looked about,
a new fear swept through her. It was
growing light in the East; soon the shadows
would be gone and she would be
caught without a den far from the woodchuck
burrow from which, early in the
night, she had made this journey with
such assurance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>She turned back, slowly retracing her
steps to the edge of the wood where
stood the rows of brush piles. Here she
began to hunt for a temporary hiding
place. The brush piles had not been
there long enough to have settled into
tight, safe retreats; but one of them had
a base of logs under which the wood
pussy found a narrow hole. Into this
she pushed her way only to be startled by
the sudden scampering of some animal
which had already made this a home.</p>
<p>It was Bun, the woods rabbit. He
was big, but his teeth and mouth were
shaped for gnawing soft grass and bark,
not fighting, so he made way very
quickly for the skunk and waited outside
until she should leave. But this
she did not do, so after a while he grew
impatient and peeped inside only to find
her curled up in his bed of leaves fast
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Bun angrily thumped his hind feet
against the earth and complained a bit
to himself, but finally had to go away
and find another bed. He knew of
several, for he was used to this kind of
treatment on the part of the powerful
meat eaters and was always ready for a
quick change, inconvenient though it
sometimes seemed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Through the day, while the sun shone
warmly on the wood pile and the little
birds hopped about it, there was no sign
of the weary wood pussy. Once she
looked out to see whether it was safe
yet to make the trip back to the woodchuck&rsquo;s
burrow, but finding the sun high
overhead returned to Bun&rsquo;s nest. Several
times she moved uneasily and
pulled more leaves about her for bedding.
But she did not leave the woodpile
that day nor the night following,
and when in the morning the birds
awoke with the dawn and chirruped
among the twigs, there were five wood
pussies instead of one, in Bun&rsquo;s old nest,
four of them hairless, blind babies only
a few hours old, over whom the old
wood pussy was already keeping faithful,
tireless guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STRONG MEDICINE</span></h2>
<p>And so it happened that Farmer Ben
Slown had a family of skunks as
neighbors. Some people might have
been happy about it, but not he. It
was well for the family that they were
hidden under the wood pile so securely
that he did not even suspect they were
there; for Farmer Slown had never
learned to live on friendly terms with
the little woodsfolk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>He shot the crows and blackbirds because
he thought they spent most of their
time eating his crops. He set traps for
the rabbits and the woodchucks because
they nibbled his vegetables. The squirrels,
in his opinion, lived only to carry
away his corn, and the foxes, skunks,
hawks and other meat eaters were supposed
to be always on the lookout for
his chickens. Altogether he made himself
have a hard time with his wild
neighbors.</p>
<p>He had moved into the woods and
started his present farm because he
wished to be far away from every human
being, in a place where he could do
pretty much what he pleased with everything
he saw. But even Farmer Slown
could not regulate the actions of the
wild furry folk, nor know how many
pairs of bright little eyes watched the
lights of his house at night from field
and thicket and high tree top.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>No roads led into the big woods, but
the farmer had a flat bottomed boat in
which he could pole up and down Goose
Creek. Then, too, there was the woods
path along the stream, worn smooth by
deer and by countless little padded feet.
So Ben Slown was able to reach the village
when he wanted to, which was not
often.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/p028.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="179" />
<p class="caption">Striped Coat&rsquo;s foot-prints; front and hind foot.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>When finally his new neighbor, the
wood pussy, slipped from underneath
the brush pile, she was not very happy.
Out in the field, however, she could hear
the hum of night flying beetles and the
chirping of other insects, so in that direction
she wandered. Beside clods of
earth and under rubbish she poked her
nose, cleverly digging out bugs wherever
they had hidden themselves and
finding, now and then, small grubs and
worms of different kinds. No matter
how small or how big, if she could get a
hold of them that was the end of their
happy days of feeding on the Farmer&rsquo;s
crops.</p>
<p>But it was too early in the year for
many insects to have collected in a
freshly cleared field, so when she had
searched most of the ground, the wood
pussy&rsquo;s hunger was nearly as great as
ever. There remained indeed the yard
around the house and barn, and into this
apparently deserted place the little
mother&rsquo;s hunger now led her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>She crept around the dog house and
listened for a moment to the farmer&rsquo;s
old black and white hound wheezing in
his sleep and grunting every time a flea
bit him particularly hard. There were
dry bones lying about the entrance but
these she was too shy to take.</p>
<p>Next came the barn, a more interesting
building, from which issued the
strong scent of horses, poultry and the
Farmer&rsquo;s milk goat. The wood pussy
examined it very carefully, sniffing
through the cracks, straining to reach the
open windows and finally getting underneath
the floor by way of a loose board
at the rear. She saw at once that this
was a good hiding place, except for its
nearness to things she did not understand
and so could not help fearing.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p031.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="691" />
<p class="caption">The wood pussy examined it very carefully</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>But food was the important thing
now, so next she crept around the house
and hungrily picked up scraps thrown
from the kitchen door, potato peelings
for the most part, with one foot of a hen
and two fish skeletons as tid bits. An
old &rsquo;possum was there too, munching
away in sour silence and cracking bones
with his strong jaws.</p>
<p>These two were not, however, long to
enjoy their humble meal. Suddenly
Possum looked up and shuffled towards
the wood. The skunk, knowing he had
discovered something wrong, also
straightened up. She then saw sneaking
around the house the black and
white hound who had either smelled or
heard the two feasters and was coming
around to investigate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Her short legs would not make much
speed, but she did her best to reach the
hole under the barn. This however
served only to bring on the hound full
tilt to head her off. Being a noisy fellow
he fairly bellowed with joy when he
caught up and had her almost in his
jaws.</p>
<p>But just in time she turned on him
and threw up so quickly her dangerous
looking, fluffy tail that he checked himself
and began to dance around her in a
circle, looking for a better chance to rush
in without in any way getting hurt himself.
The noise was quite enough to
bring Farmer Slown&rsquo;s tousled head out
of the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on around here!&rdquo; he
thundered. In the dark he could not
see what kind of creature the dog had
found, but wanted it killed anyway.
&ldquo;Sic &rsquo;em, you!&rdquo; he encouraged, &ldquo;sic
&rsquo;em!&rdquo; But the hound was a big coward
at heart and only danced about all the
more.</p>
<p>The Farmer grew angry at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you wait!&rdquo; he muttered, and
vanished from the window only to appear
at the door, clad in his blue night
shirt and armed with a gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, go for him!&rdquo; he called and ran
out to help the dog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>That was enough encouragement for
the hound. Just as his master came up,
he excitedly threw himself on the wood
pussy, but not before that quick little
animal had twisted herself around and
given him a terrible musk bath square
in the eyes and mouth. She could not
run fast, her claws were not made for
scratching, nor her teeth for fighting, but
she had instead this weapon of defense
which was enough to stop any hound.</p>
<p>With a yowl of pain the surprised
dog threw himself on the ground and
tried to rub the smarting stuff from his
half blinded eyes. He wildly rolled
and rubbed and finally in desperate fear
and pain rushed to Farmer Slown and
bounded against him again and again
regardless of the man&rsquo;s frantic efforts to
keep him away.</p>
<p>The dog, the man, the yard and indeed
the whole farm were wrapped in a
cloud of horrible odor. But the little
wood pussy, unhurt and untouched by
the musk, was nowhere to be seen. She
had vanished in the confusion and soon
was nursing the hungry young ones safe
under the brush pile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>That night, the little watchers about
the clearing could have seen an angry
looking figure in a blue night shirt striding
down the path to the waters of Goose
Creek. A big bar of soap and a towel
went along too, also a strong smell, suggestive
of fumes from a burning gum
shoe factory. Also there was some fiery
language about fool dogs, wood pussies
in general and a certain one especially.
Oh, it was a great night on Goose Creek!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">UNDER THE BRUSH PILE</span></h2>
<p>The next day found the farm still
rich with the bitter odor of musk.
The Farmer&rsquo;s brisk scrubbing in the
waters of Goose Creek removed the
worst of the scent from his own limbs,
but plenty remained to keep him reminded
of the night&rsquo;s experience. So
he and his hound went about with sore
noses hating themselves and brooding
over the mean treatment they thought
they had received. Each vowed vengeance
in his own way, but neither felt
especially anxious to again meet the
little wood pussy face to face. There
was enough perfume around the farm
already. It was all very well to get an
occasional whiff of an odor so interestingly
awful, but to have it follow them
about everywhere and almost live with
them, was quite another affair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>On the second day, however, a strong
breeze carried away much of the objectionable
smell and Farmer Slown
breathed easier. He even plucked up
enough courage to hunt around his field
and in the neighboring thickets for the
wood pussy&rsquo;s den, which he was shrewd
enough to guess was nearby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The brush piles quickly caught his
eye. He poked around the first one,
then moved to the next and finally
reached the very one under which slept
the baby skunks and their mother.
This one looked more promising than
the others, so the Farmer got down on
his hands and knees and cautiously&mdash;oh,
exceedingly carefully&mdash;peered under
the logs.</p>
<p>Inside, the mother, hearing the heavy
footsteps and the cracking of the brush,
stood up in readiness to defend the little
ones with her musk and with her own
life if necessary. She made no sound,
the young ones absorbing her fear, also
keeping very still, waiting, as if knowing
that terrible danger was near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>And Farmer Slown looked and listened
and sniffed but could discover
nothing. He was not entirely satisfied,
however, and so took the risk of moving
closer. He was well within the
wood pussy&rsquo;s fatal aim, but still did not
know it. Then he poked his red face
so close to the ground that a low briar
pricked his nose. With an exclamation
he drew back only to find that another
had caught his ear and become partly
wound around his neck.</p>
<p>At once his quick temper broke loose.
Tearing himself free he kicked about
him to destroy the offending bushes, and
failing in this, strode away. Thus the
meddlesome Farmer was saved from a
much worse dose of musk than he received
the first time. But more trouble
was brewing; the man had made up his
mind that the brush heaps were bad
things to have near his fields, he had decided
to burn them. That day, however,
he did not have time, and on the
next it rained, so the wood pussies lived
on; and every day the little ones grew
bigger and stronger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>But while Farmer Slown did not find
the little family, the nest was not hidden
from the prying eyes and keen
noses of the woodsfolk. Gray Fox,
trotting by on the first night, had at
once caught the faint scent of the baby
skunks and turned to investigate. He
had, however, found the mother on
guard and so that time had passed on.</p>
<p>Another who found the place was the
mother mink with whom the wood
pussy had already had trouble. As
usual Mink was hungry; she had four
little ones of her own in a burrow under
a cedar whose roots dipped into
Goose Creek. Therefore she sneaked
under the woodpile and might have
carried off one or all of the baby skunks
if their mother had not returned suddenly
and sprung upon her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Mink, knowing herself in the wrong,
backed off snarling, then flashed out
of the woodpile and away. Both she
and Gray Fox, however, remembered
that here was something young, helpless
and good to eat. Sometime when
they came in that direction the mother
might not be near and then&mdash;but somehow
the wise faithful mother seemed
to know their designs and to try always
to be on guard.</p>
<p>However this was a very unprotected
place for the little skunks and none felt
it more than the mother. After Farmer
Slown&rsquo;s visit she became too uneasy to
stay there any longer and thought only
of making a move all the way back to
the woodchuck&rsquo;s deep burrow which had
been her safe home all winter. Indeed,
no sooner had night come again than
she seized the nearest young one in her
teeth and started out with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>This young one was not like the
others. To begin with he was stouter.
Then, too, instead of having a black
and white back like his brothers and
sisters he was pure black all over except
where two narrow white stripes came
from the top of his head down either
side of his neck. This little fellow was
also peculiar in his habits. Nearly all
night, while the others nervously
crawled about, he lay happily on his
back or flat on his stomach resting.
But no sooner would the mother return
to feed them than he would hear or
smell her and spring up so quickly that
he would be eating with furious energy
before the others knew quite what was
happening. And so he got much food
and rest and grew very fast. All over
his body the fur was beginning to show.
It was short, thick and soft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Now the mother, in her anxious state
had started on an impossible task.
The woodchuck&rsquo;s burrow was much too
far away to be reached in a night by a
mother skunk with four youngsters that
had to be carried one at a time. She
had gone scarcely fifty yards with this
one when her jaws and neck became
very tired from lugging the fat, furry
little fellow. He was slippery as well
as heavy. Laying him down in the
path, she rested, and at that moment
caught a glimpse of Mink galloping
through the woods towards the brush
pile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>The wood pussy looked after this
ruthless enemy and started to follow,
forgetting the baby at her feet until by
luck she tripped over him. Instantly
picking him up by the neck she hurried
back towards the nest. She was not as
swift as Mink, but fear for the other
young ones spurred her on until it
seemed as if the youngster in her mouth
would nearly be torn to pieces by the
bushes they sped through, or choked by
her tight hold.</p>
<p>Suddenly the brush pile was directly
in front of them, and the mother
slowed up as if afraid to face the sight
she might find. In the next instant,
however, she had rushed underneath,
every hair on end, every nerve keyed
for battle. But Mink was not there,
she had returned in time!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>A noise at the entrance caught her ear.
She whirled around only to find that
the young one she had dropped there in
coming in, had gotten back some of his
breath and was crawling shakily to the
nest. Quickly picking him up she
placed him among the others and then
sprawled herself over them, panting,
almost exhausted but ready for Mink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>And Mink came, smelled about outside,
found to her surprise that the
mother was again on guard and hastily
bounded away to other hunting grounds.
But for an hour or more the wood pussy
stayed there resting and assuring herself
through the feel of all those moving
little bodies underneath her, that all
were really safe. She had wisely given
up the idea of moving them to the
woodchuck burrow. When, later on
hunger drove her forth, she chose another
direction, and did not go further
than the edge of the field where big,
buzzing bugs were laying eggs in the
grass, and where lizards often hid for
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">EVERY ANIMAL MUST EAT</span></h2>
<p>Farmer Slown was plowing the
corner of the field nearest Goose
Creek. It was not far from the wood-pussies&rsquo;
den, so the clank of the plow
chains and the loud commands of &ldquo;gid
up,&rdquo; &ldquo;whoa there,&rdquo; kept the skunk family
from their usual morning sleep.
Then, too, the black and white hound
amused himself by sniffing about until
he discovered the hiding place of Bun,
the woods rabbit, whom he chased for a
long time with much crashing of brush
and excited baying. Bun led the
stupid hound to all the most prickly
briar patches and then hid in a hollow
log. The hound was too big to follow
him there and so, after growling and
gnawing at the entrance until his mouth
was sore, gave up the chase and slunk
away to rest and lick his scratches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Then lunch time arrived and the
Farmer unhooked the two horses from
the plow and tied them to the fence,
where they could munch corn he spread
for them on some sacking. He then
walked across the field to the farm yard
to milk the goat and prepare his own
meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>No sooner had he gone from sight
than Jim Crow came flying from the
woods for a look around. His sharp
eyes at once saw the corn, but he said
nothing and turned back to the woods
to wait until the horses had moved
away. At the same time however Red
Squirrel, running about in the pines
along the edge of the field, had also
made a discovery of the corn. He
looked all around to make sure he was
the only one who had seen this food
treasure, then sneaked to a nearby limb
impatiently to watch for a chance to get
a part of it.</p>
<p>But Gray Squirrel too had noticed
the grain, and so also had a keen nosed
deer mouse and a meadow mouse who
lived in a round nest of grass hidden in
a tangle of weeds beside the very posts
to which the horses were tethered. So
also had some black birds and a pair of
starlings, and a blue jay and almost
countless other creatures always on the
watch for food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Therefore when the afternoon plowing
was over and the horses had been
led back to the barn, birds began to
arrive as if by magic to gather the scattered
kernels. First appeared a mother
quail with ten young ones not much
larger than bumble bees following her
as chicks follow a mother hen. She
picked up a few of the smaller grains,
then scurried away as big Jim Crow
swooped down. He was followed by
the starlings. Suddenly Red Squirrel
sounded his rattle from the wood. Up
flew Jim and the starlings in alarm only
to see the little red fellow dash along
the top of the fence, seize a big kernel
and then rush back with it to a safe retreat.
And so the feeding continued,
with interruptions, until night came
and only the mice and flying squirrels
were left to hunt the very few kernels
which remained. Although the horses
had been careless with their feed, there
had been no waste&mdash;the woods people
had seen to that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>And soon from the brush pile, slipped
the mother wood pussy. She had heard
sounds of the feasting and now caught
the scent left by some of the little creatures.
She walked forward sniffing.
Suddenly, up a fence post close by, ran
Flying Squirrel. Out of reach of the
hungry wood pussy, he squeaked shrilly
and scolded. But the mother skunk
was paying no attention, she had caught
the fresh scent of the meadow mouse
which lived in the grass nest beside the
post.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>The mouse had been eating a grain
of corn when Flying Squirrel&rsquo;s sudden
alarm signal had sent her scurrying
down her tunnel under the dead grass
and leaves. Now, seeing no enemy,
she was cautiously coming back to find
the grain. Soon she was again gnawing
away at it with a rasping noise
which, slight as it was, caught the ear
of the wood pussy and led her right to
the spot.</p>
<p>The next thing the busy mouse saw
was a pointed black and white head and
two black paws directly above her.
Without wasting breath for even a
squeak of fear, she dashed headlong
into her tunnel. The wood pussy
could not open the tunnel quickly
enough with her paws to catch up and
so the mouse escaped that time.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/p056.jpg" alt="" width="686" height="500" />
<p class="caption">The mouse had left in the nest her whole family of five young ones</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>But the skunk was a better mouser
than any cat. With her strong claws
she dug along the tunnels and runways,
chasing the mouse from place to place
until at last she came to the nest of
grass. Her nose told her that the
mouse was inside. Now was her
chance! Poking her sharp head into
the round entrance to keep the mouse
from bolting out and past her, she dug
into the mass of woven grasses with
her front paws. Soon out came a mass
of soft lining material made of shredded
bark and tender dry grass blades,
but no fat mouse. The little creature
had wisely made a back door with a
special safety tunnel leading into the
underground burrow of a mole. Down
this she had dodged. Even the wood
pussy could not follow her there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>However the mouse, thinking only
of saving herself had left in the nest
her whole family of five young ones.
Their eyes were still tight shut and
their bodies hairless. If left undisturbed,
however, they would soon have
grown up and been running about like
the mother making tunnels in the grass
far and wide, to the disgust of Farmer
Slown. So the wood pussy did the
Farmer a good turn, though to her it
was only a matter of easing her empty,
aching stomach with a meal and providing
food for her young ones.</p>
<p>Next day the mother mouse began to
build another snug nest in a different
place, in which in less than three weeks
she was raising another family.</p>
<p>Under the wood pile, the young
wood pussies were more lively than
ever. It was four weeks since they
were born, and their eyes were open;
also their tender legs were growing
strong enough to support their little
furry bodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The fat black one with the white
stripes on his head and neck&mdash;the one
who had had such a rough journey with
the mother the night she tried to move
the family to the woodchuck&rsquo;s burrow,
was still the largest. He lay now on
his back as usual, apparently fast asleep.
It did not seem to matter to him how
many times the others climbed over him
or stepped on his face. But with the
first step of the mother in the entrance,
he was on his feet and waddling towards
her with hungry little mouth
open. She liked the little fellow and
rarely disappointed him. And it was
he who a year later became known as
&ldquo;Striped Coat&rdquo; from one end of Goose
Creek to the other&mdash;yes, and even
further, for fame travels fast in the
woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>At five weeks of age he was like a
little black ball of fur with a handle to
it, which was his tail. His teeth were
strong by that time and he often helped
the others strip the feathers off some
tough old blackbird or crow which the
Farmer had shot in the field and left
there, and which the mother had
dragged under the brushpile for a feast.
No matter how dead the bird, he would
always pounce upon it as if it might
escape, then pull and worry at its feathers
and finally seize it by the head and
try to drag it to a corner, away from the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>This always caused a big rumpus.
The others would seize the bird and try
to pull it in the other direction. All
four tugging together on one end could
drag Striped Coat all about the place,
and they always did this. But while it
was going on, Striped Coat was as busy
as a bee chewing on the bird&rsquo;s neck and
swallowing just as much as he could
get into his mouth at a time, until he
was as solidly stuffed as a plum pudding.
No wonder he slept soundly all
day sprawled on his stomach, or with all
four feet up in the air. Life under the
brush pile was a happy one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE BURNING WOODS</span></h2>
<p>One fine day the Mother uncurled
herself and sat up in the nest to
sniff the air. The young ones awoke
one by one, and sniffed too, that is, all
except Striped Coat whose four black
paws still pointed at the sky as he lay
on his back sleeping off the effects of his
last stuffing. There was a smell of
smoke. Farmer Slown, true to his
threat, was burning the brush piles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>Soon the smoke drifted past in masses,
driven by a brisk breeze blowing towards
Goose Creek. There was a crackling
and snapping noise, with now and
then a roar when the flames leaped high.
Even the sun lost its brilliancy and
could only glow dully like a red hot
ball in the smoke.</p>
<p>The mother wood pussy walked about
uneasily, looking out at the smoke from
each peep hole in the brush pile. Some
of the woods folk were running by in
a stupid panicky way, looking this way
and that, and often turning back when
they should have gone only forward.
Bun, the woods rabbit, actually came
into the den and crouched there a moment
before rushing on. Possum, his
long mouth open and dripping saliva,
shuffled in a moment later. Ignoring
the skunks he curled up on a log and
watched in sour silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Mice and little sharp nosed shrews
were hopping about like big grasshoppers
with apparently no idea of the
right direction. At first the Farmer
had chased these with his rake. Now,
however, the smoke was too thick, the
fire had spread far beyond his control
and was threatening to sweep the whole
wood. The Farmer&rsquo;s one idea was to
stop the flames before they reached his
buildings. He worked frantically, digging
and raking, stamping and beating
until the fire in a great wave had swept
with the wind all the way to Goose
Creek and there had been checked by
the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Meanwhile its fiery breath reached
one brush pile after another, licking
them up and sweeping on. The mother
wood pussy waited as long as she dared,
then panicky from the roar, the stifling
smoke and the heat, she seized one of
the young ones and tried to carry it out.
It was heavy and slippery, she lost her
hold and blinded by the smoke could not
find it. Returning she seized first one,
then another and then in her excitement
tried to carry two out together. This
failed. But her efforts and fear aroused
the young ones, they understood that
they had to flee from their home. So
when the mother was forced by the
smoke to move out, the young ones
trooped after her on their own legs, making
a long line of black and white
stripes as each followed the tail of the
one ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Last of all came the smallest and in
front of him came Striped Coat with
every hair of his body on end and his
tail straight up in the danger signal.
Through the smoke they wandered towards
the field, then along the fence,
away from the path of the roaring
flames.</p>
<p>It was a queer little company. Each
stumbling along as best he could, bristling
up whenever strange objects like
roots or stumps loomed suddenly out of
the smoke, sneezing and choking when
the tricky wind blew the fire towards
them. Well it was that each had showy
white stripes which those behind could
plainly see and follow, just as men in
the dark follow a lantern. For in that
way the mother was able to lead them
the whole length of the fence and then
around the corner to the edge of Farmer
Slown&rsquo;s barn where, as if she had been
aiming for it all the time, the mother
found the hole under the floor and
slipped in. After her solemnly trooped
the little ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>And it was a strange thing that between
them and the fire, their enemy,
the Farmer, was working for all he was
worth to save his home and at the same
time to do what would also save their
lives. He did not know that a skunk
family was under his precious barn, but
he had found out for himself that a fire
in the woods was a terribly dangerous
thing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>When, thanks to the help of Goose
Creek, the Farmer had put out the last
flame, he was nearly exhausted and in
much worse condition than most of the
little woods folk he had tried to destroy.
To be sure many of them were homeless,
but they could find or make new homes.
Indeed, when that night the mother
wood pussy slipped from under the
barn and wandered across the field to
the stretch of burned woods beyond, she
found the mice already in new holes
along the edge of the field and Possum
carrying, in a bundle held by his tail,
a lot of straw for a new bed he was making
in a hollow oak.</p>
<p>Where the brush piles had stood, and
beyond, all the way to the creek, every
living thing was blackened and dying.
Trees thirty feet high were scorched.
The ground was almost bare. Many
years would go by before the forest
could cover the ugly scars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Wandering about in an uncertain,
awed way were several meat eaters besides
the wood pussy. Gray Fox and
his mate were slipping from shadow to
shadow examining everything, a mother
coon and her three young ones passed
along the edge of the creek, and overhead
Screech Owl and several of his
kind were talking it all over in gentle
crooning voices.</p>
<p>The wood pussy could find no trace
of her old home, the brush pile. It was
gone. So after a little while she left
the gloomy place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Near the field she picked up a small
toad and a yellow and brown garter
snake, both killed by the fire. These
and a number of wild strawberries were
food enough, and she was too tired to
hunt more. Back then to Farmer
Slown&rsquo;s barn she wandered. It was
not quite the kind of a place she would
have selected for a den, but there seemed
no other to which to take the young
ones. Stealthily she circled the farm
yard and slipped into the hole. It was
smelly and damp and cold under the
barn floor, but what she thought of most
was whether it was safe. Several times
she looked out and wandered about uneasily,
each time returning to the young
ones to lick and mother them. They
seemed utterly tired out; so she began
gathering together leaves for a bed in
the farthest corner; she had decided to
stay.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic5">

<p class="caption">Several times she looked out and wandered about uneasily</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GOOD HUNTING</span></h2>
<p>Farmer Slown owned six
chickens. One of them was a
white pullet which, having not yet made
a nest, spent much time in going about
hunting a good place and in telling the
others about her difficulties. The
morning after the skunk family took up
residence under the barn she was still
wandering around cackling and complaining.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cawk cawk cawk caw-w-w-w-k,&rdquo; she
muttered as she strolled around the corner
of the barn. Striped Coat, lying
as usual on his back, turned over quickly
and looked about. &ldquo;Cawk cawk cawk
caw-w-w-w-k,&rdquo; again muttered the
pullet. The little skunk slipped away
from the others and peeped out of the
hole at the strange white bird strolling
about so close to him.</p>
<p>He was fascinated. Often he had
seen and eaten crows, but here was a
white one which his little nose told him
would be especially good eating.
Whenever the pullet passed the hole,
he moved to the side where he could get
the best view, but peeped so timidly
that she did not see him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Suddenly she got the idea that in
some litter under the edge of the barn,
would be a good place for her nest.
She looked about, scratched around a
little and then settled down to form the
nest around her in a comfortable fit.
Striped Coat never took his eyes off this
white &ldquo;crow,&rdquo; and when with a joyful
cackle the pullet sprang up and raced
to the other fowls to announce that she
had laid an egg, Striped Coat&rsquo;s excitement
knew no bounds. Forgetting all
natural caution he galloped out to have
a look at the nest.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the white crow had forgotten
something when she left so hurriedly.
He pounced on the egg, tried
to kill it and finding it a very strange
hard object, sat down in the nest to
study out how it could be eaten. But
the egg was too large for his small mouth
and he was still rolling it about when the
mother came out to see what he was up
to.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>With one bite she took the shell off
one end, then sucked the contents.
Striped Coat, the discoverer, hustled
around her eagerly, but got only the
drippings and what was left on the edges
of the shell. Nevertheless the mother&rsquo;s
respect for him increased. He was,
in her mind, already a successful hunter.
So when that night she came out for her
own regular hunt she let Striped Coat
come too.</p>
<p>It was dark and damp, just the weather
beloved by the night prowlers.
The smell of the flowering shrubs and of
countless things in the woods, lay heavy
in the air. The little skunk, trailing
after his mother&rsquo;s guiding white stripes,
picked his way as fast as he could behind
her, but without missing a look at
anything especially interesting along the
way. When she stopped to sniff at a
mouse burrow or to dig under a stump
for a sleeping lizard, or to examine an
ant nest for young ones and eggs, he
was always where he would miss nothing
of the fun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>He tried this once too often however,
for the mother finally discovered the
underground nest of a swarm of yellow
jackets and began to dig it up in spite
of the great consternation of the inhabitants.
They tumbled out in masses
and stung everything in sight including
Striped Coat whose hair was not
yet long enough to protect him all over
his body. He rushed about and rolled
but was so fat that the stinging could
not hurt him badly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Although the yellow jackets had not
yet made a very big nest, what paper
combs there were seemed almost choked
with the amount of young brood they
carried&mdash;tasty morsels for an insect loving
animal like a wood pussy, and well
worth a little digging and an occasional
sting where the full grown little fighters
were able to get under the fur.</p>
<p>After that feast the mother seemed
content to let Striped Coat do a little
hunting for himself while she moved
about slowly, occasionally finding a
berry, or an unwary beetle on the surface
of the ground. And Striped Coat
made good use of his opportunity, in
tasting many kinds of plants and roots
and in learning where the night crawling
earth worms could be found and
caught before they pulled their long
bodies back into their burrows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>All too soon, the mother grew uneasy
about the coming of day and started
back. Striped Coat followed but this
time found difficulty in keeping up;
there were no stops now, the mother
thought only of getting back to the barn.
So the little skunk, work his short legs
as he would, kept dropping behind.
Added to this strain was the presence
of a big bird, Great Horned Owl, who
flew silently from tree to tree, at a little
distance from them but always nearly
abreast of their course. There was
something so stealthy about his watchful
waiting that Striped Coat grew
afraid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>On and on went the mother with the
galloping motion used so much by the
skunks, and Striped Coat still toddled
along and kept her in sight while also
watching the big owl. Then some
bushes loomed ahead and the little skunk
found himself suddenly alone. A
shadow seemed to pass over him; he
dodged into the bushes like a flash and
escaped the talons of Great Horned
Owl by a mere inch. Indeed, where he
had been a moment before, now stood
the big bird, its eyes glaring, wings
ready for another dash and strike.</p>
<p>Striped Coat cowered back against
what seemed a solid wall of stems, and
the owl noting his fear, started into the
bushes after him; but suddenly things
changed; with a stamp of his foot the
little fellow sidled forward, every hair
on end, his tail straight over his back.
The owl hesitated; he was facing more
of a proposition than he had bargained
for. The little skunk looked young
and defenseless, but it acted very grown
up. The owl knew what an old wood
pussy could do.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic6">
<img src="images/p081.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="688" />
<p class="caption">Where he had been a moment before, now stood the big bird,
its eyes glaring, wings ready for another dash and strike</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Snapping his hooked beak, the big
bird backed away and with a final glare,
took wing as silently as he had come.
A minute later his &ldquo;Hu hu, huua hu,&rdquo;
sounded nearby as he called to locate
his mate, then further, and finally so far
away it was like a faint echo in the distance.
Then Striped Coat came out
and continued his journey, and it might
have been noticed that now he walked
along with a kind of self confident dignity,
every hair still on end. More
than ever he looked like a little fur ball,
but not the kind with which it is safe
to play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Sniffing along his mother&rsquo;s trail, he
very quickly came in sight of the hole
under the barn, but before going in he
took a look at the nest of his friend the
white crow, then, all puffed up, with
furry tail still proudly held up like a
flag, he marched in to join the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">STRANGE HAPPENINGS</span></h2>
<p>A furious thunder storm was
sweeping down Goose Creek; hailstones
nearly the size of marbles
bounded from limb to limb or cut
through the tender leaves on their way
to earth. Such things sometimes happened
in the last days of June, but
rarely were they followed by a wind as
cold as that which in the night swept
through the pines around the barn of
Farmer Slown. It whistled in the holes
and cracks and made the wood pussies&rsquo;
new home drafty and uncomfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>So the mother very wisely went out
in search of warmer covering for their
nest and after digging into leaf piles
and finding them disagreeably wet,
turned her attention to hunting strips
of bark on the dry sides of dead trees.
This search brought her to Farmer
Slown&rsquo;s fence, the posts of which she
carefully examined until, within the
yard, very near the barn, she found just
what she wanted. But it was not bark,
it was the Farmer&rsquo;s blue cotton night
shirt which, following the storm, he had
hung on the fence to dry and had forgotten
to bring in with the rest of his
wash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The mother reached up to feel it,
then taking a firm hold with her teeth,
pulled and swung it about until her
weight brought it down on top of her.
This surprised her mightily, and being
entangled in its folds she nearly gave
it a better musk bath than it had had on
the eventful evening when the Farmer
came out of his bed to the aid of his
cowardly hound. With her under it the
night shirt performed some strange antics;
then suddenly it released her and
fell in such a helpless heap that excited
as she was she realized it was after all
not a living enemy which had leaped
upon her. Instantly calming down,
she dragged it under the barn where
some chewing and tearing on the part
of the whole family soon made it into
very good bedding, though Farmer
Slown might not have thought so. Indeed,
he was in one of his rages all the
next day while hunting for it in vain
from one end of his field to the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>But comfortable as the blue night
shirt proved to be, the mother was not
quite satisfied with her bed, and so on
the following night went out in search
of something else warm. She looked
first to see if by any chance there might
be another night shirt growing on the
fence, but was very satisfied at finding
instead two pairs of socks and an undershirt
which the Farmer, still following
his usual habit, had unwisely hung out
on this makeshift clothesline.</p>
<p>After supper he remembered the
clothes and went out to bring them in,
but, feel about as much as he liked, he
could not find them, they were gone, absolutely
and completely. Then he
grew really peeved and, using some
harsh language, commenced a ferocious
march around the yard, armed with a
lantern and a stick. At length, still
completely mystified, he sat down on
his doorstep to think the thing out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Last night it was the night shirt,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Tonight it&rsquo;s socks and an
undershirt! What on earth can be doing
all this dirty work? It can&rsquo;t very
well be the wind blowing them away.
It couldn&rsquo;t be an eagle; nor a tramp
way out here; it can&rsquo;t be the goat&mdash;no,
the goat would do it all right, but she&rsquo;s
safely tied. Bugs couldn&rsquo;t have eaten
them. Pshaw! I can&rsquo;t see what did
take them, but one thing I am sure of
and that is that they didn&rsquo;t walk off by
themselves!&rdquo; With that he slapped a
mosquito on his neck and went inside
the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>A few minutes later, however, he
strode out like one to whom has suddenly
come a great idea. In his hand
were two socks which he proceeded to
nail to the fence with the feet hanging
down as naturally as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you spook you, get those if
you can!&rdquo; he said encouragingly. Returning
then to the house he put out the
lights and posted himself at an open
window with shot gun at his elbow and
a pocket full of spare cartridges. As he
looked at the bait on the fence opposite
he chuckled grimly and acknowledged
himself very clever indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>But if the weird creature, whatever
it was, had earlier been eager for his
clothes it certainly was so no longer.
Hours passed and still the Farmer sat
there with eye glued on the two socks
hanging in the moonlight. Behind
them the woods came in close and black,
throwing long shadows which moved
from time to time under the influence of
the night wind. There was a gentle
rustle of countless leaves, the hooting
of distant owls, the call of Great Blue
Heron and the patter of flying squirrels
as they leaped onto his roof from the
nearest tall tree. There was also the
endless hum of the insect army, increased
now and then by the rasping of
a locust in a limb close by; but nothing
of an unusual nature.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Farmer rubbed his eyes
and leaned forward, then rubbed them
again; one sock was gone! Yes, there
was no doubt about it! He had seen
nothing, heard nothing strange, yet
there in the moving black and white
shadows hung only one lone sock. It
seemed so impossible that he just sat
there with mouth open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>A few minutes later, however, he
reached stealthily for his gun with a
hand that trembled oddly. His eyes
had a queer bulge and chills were running
up his spine and into the roots of
his stiff hair. The other sock was gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Carefully closing the window, Farmer
Slown tiptoed about the house,
noiselessly barring doors and even propping
things against them. For the
first time in his life he had seen something
uncanny, had felt that the great
woods contained something more cunning,
perhaps more powerful, than he.
He shivered while listening suspiciously.
And at this unfortunate moment,
the black and white hound took
the notion to feel lonely and to howl at
the moon. It was the lonesomest, most
woebegone sound imaginable. Perhaps
it could not be said that the Farmer
ran up the dark stairs, rather might it
be said that he flew. Behind the locked
door of his room he felt better, but still
the weird loneliness of the dark woods
came through from the window. With
a jerk he pulled down the shade, then
jumped into bed, clothes and all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>If he felt shivery that night, at least
the wood pussies did not. The mother
was now entirely satisfied with their
nest, for it was truly a wonderful one.
She had found the last two socks somewhat
harder to tear down than the
others, but had managed to get them by
pulling the ends through the fence one
at a time and then straining back with
all her strength until the wool stretched
on the nail and gave way with such suddenness
as to roll her over. This
stretching and sudden jerk was what
caused each sock to vanish through the
fence so quickly that the Farmer could
not see it go. The moving shadows did
the rest. Into them the black wood
pussy with her long white stripes fitted
in as naturally as if a part of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MYSTERY SOLVED</span></h2>
<p>Farmer Slown arose early,
milked the goat with nervous
speed, breakfasted on one less egg than
usual and started for the village in his
flat-bottomed boat. His principal errand
there was the buying of two huge
steel traps guaranteed to hold anything
up to a grizzly bear in size. These two
traps having long been on exhibit in a
hardware store window as curiosities to
draw a crowd and to help advertise the
store&rsquo;s wares, their purchase by the
Farmer very naturally aroused the curiosity
of the shopkeeper and of several
village loungers who happened to be
witnesses of the sale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>Questions soon drew from the Farmer
enough details of the strange doings
on Goose Creek to make a very good
story. He was buying the huge traps
to catch some uncanny creature which
visited his farm at night and carried off
whole clothes lines. That was enough
for the village gossips. They enlarged
the story at each telling until it became
a regular fairy tale, with the villain a
creature nearly as high as the trees,
marching about in the woods terrorizing
the inhabitants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>So sure did the gossips become of the
truth of the story, that they even made
Farmer Slown wonder whether it might
not be true. He stayed all day in the
village repeating his version of it to all
the newcomers and so thoroughly enjoying
being a hero that he let his own imagination
work a little to make the story
better. He even described the dreadful
creature as he thought it ought to
look. Needless to say it did not resemble
a little wood pussy.</p>
<p>One of those who took great interest
in the affair was the Editor of the little
local paper. He saw a great opportunity
and made the most of it in a special
afternoon edition with the story under
black headlines and illustrated with
sketches of a creature as large as a house
and resembling a cross between a camel
and an elephant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The little paper circulated far and
wide and was quoted by papers elsewhere
until the story in its exaggerated
form, was being discussed in the biggest
cities. The general conclusion seemed
to be that someone had gone loony or
else that a prehistoric mammal had been
hiding in the Pine Barrens all these
years and had now suddenly been discovered.</p>
<p>In a week Goose Creek was a famous
place. Newspapers sent photographers
there who poled up and down the
stream taking pictures of places wild
enough to be the den of the monster and
of any holes in the mud which might be
taken for its foot prints. And Farmer
Slown was still the great hero whom
everyone had to visit and listen to and
sympathize with.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic7">
<img src="images/p100.jpg" alt="" width="687" height="500" />
<p class="caption">He approached with caution</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Meanwhile the wood pussies, cause
of all the excitement, could not understand
what had happened to make the
place so noisy and unsafe for them.
There were strange people and strange
dogs in the woods, there were shouts
and gunshots and new odors. The
mother, always nervous, hunted for a
new den and finally moved the family
to a deserted woodchuck burrow under
a holly tree in the middle of the burned
section of the wood, not very far from
where the brush pile had once stood.</p>
<p>But Striped Coat did not like the
change. The other young ones were
quarrelsome and the new quarters were
crowded. Also he missed his white
crow. So after one day in the burrow
he made a trip all by himself back to
the barn, looking more than ever like a
fur ball as, all fluffed up with excitement,
he marched along the field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Nor had his white crow disappointed
him. He approached with caution and
in her nest found a fine egg, with a
shell thin enough for him to crack. Its
luscious contents were both food and
drink. Afterwards he wandered under
the barn and remodelled the bed to suit
his own needs. The remains of the
blue night shirt he draped around the
top, the socks he stuffed underneath.
By morning he was curled up in the
middle of the comfortable mass, fast
asleep.</p>
<p>That day a city cousin of the Farmer,
a Mrs. Simpkins, arrived by boat to get
first hand details of the strange affairs
which had so suddenly made the family
famous. She brought as companion her
son, an overgrown boy named Oswald
who, having read a good many books,
thought himself pretty smart, and perhaps
he was. At any rate, while his
mother was talking to the Farmer in the
parlor, Oswald nosed about the farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>He managed to escape disaster, except
for one bee sting and a good butting
from the goat, until by mere chance
he wandered back of the barn and
caught sight of the hole leading underneath
it. Here was mystery! In true
detective fashion he examined the opening
and found two large hairs, one
black the other white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cat!&rdquo; said the bright Oswald.
&ldquo;Maybe it has kittens under here. I&rsquo;ll
have a look.&rdquo; Getting down on his
stomach he wormed his way under the
barn until, his eyes becoming used to
the darkness, he could see all about.
Everything was bare except in one corner.
Oswald elbowed his way in that
direction. Yes, he had certainly found
the kittens, for here was a bed for them,
all nicely made with rags!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pussy, pussy,&rdquo; called Oswald. He
did not want to surprise an angry cat.
&ldquo;Pussy, pussy.&rdquo; And then to his joy
there stood up in the middle of the nest
not a big mother cat but a fluffy black
kitten with white stripes on its head and
neck.</p>
<p>Oswald&rsquo;s heart gave a thump of delight.
Here was just the pet for him.
He would catch it and take it home.
Of course his cousin the Farmer
wouldn&rsquo;t mind, since it was he who had
found it. But he must not let it get
away! Craftily advancing an arm under
cover of many &ldquo;pussy, pussies,&rdquo; he
felt the right moment had come.
Around went his hand in a sudden wild
grab.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yow-w-w-w-w!&rdquo; howled Oswald as
the little &ldquo;kitten&rdquo; gave him a musk
bath precisely where it would do the
most good&mdash;&ldquo;Yow-w-w-w-w!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not see and he could not
breathe, so he made up for it in yells
which even reached his mother in the
Farmer&rsquo;s parlor. She had just been
telling her cousin what a wonderful boy
her Oswald was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;he isn&rsquo;t like
other boys at all. He is never idle, he
is always finding out things for himself
or doing something splendid! Ah!
What&rsquo;s that! I think I hear him calling.
He always does that when he&rsquo;s
found something wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Simpkins and the Farmer
went out of the house to see what Oswald
had found. They heard him all
right, but they could not find him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yow-w-w-w-w!&rdquo; howled Oswald
more wild with fury because his fond
Mamma had not at once come to his
rescue. &ldquo;Yow-w-w-w-w!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds as if he were under the
barn!&rdquo; exclaimed the Farmer at last.
He walked around to the back and
there found a foot sticking out of the
hole. Dodging a kick, he seized the
foot and began to pull, Mrs. Simpkins,
now much alarmed, pulling also until
between them they nearly pulled Oswald
in two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; gurgled Mrs.
Simpkins as more body appeared and
the sound of the yells grew louder.
&ldquo;Oh, what an awful smell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say so, too!&rdquo; agreed the Farmer
heartily. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s poke him back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>But just then the whole of Oswald
came out and his mother clasped him to
her in utter disregard of consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Simpkins tragically,
&ldquo;what has happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kitty!&rdquo; cried Oswald, &ldquo;a little
black kitty with a white striped coat.&rdquo;
Then, seeing the Farmer&rsquo;s convulsed
face, his tears drowned all else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; crooned
his mother, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got
in your hand?&rdquo; The Farmer looked
too and all at once his face grew very
red. Tightly clutched in Oswald&rsquo;s
hand was all that was left of the blue
night shirt.</p>
<p>A few hours later Mrs. Simpkins,
waiting with her son for a train at the
village station, was being interviewed
by an appreciative reporter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;It was all
my Oswald. He isn&rsquo;t like other boys.
He is always finding out things for himself.
He went under the barn all
alone and discovered the lost clothes.
Isn&rsquo;t he wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporter&rsquo;s eye swept appraisingly
over the blushing Oswald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he admitted reluctantly,
&ldquo;he certainly is; but, doesn&rsquo;t he smell
awful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FIFTY DOLLARS ON HIS HEAD</span></h2>
<p>Farmer Slown was sitting on
his doorstep reading another special
edition of the village paper. Opposite
him stood a stranger watching with
amusement the changing expression on
the Farmer&rsquo;s red face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the line I referred to,&rdquo; he interrupted
the other man. &ldquo;See, right
here!&rdquo; He pointed to a paragraph.
The Farmer began to read it aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he read, &ldquo;the great monster
of the woods, the prehistoric mammal,
turned out to be nothing more than
a little skunk. The boy who made the
discovery described it as jet black all
over except for white stripes on its head
and neck. Could a more ridiculous
ending possibly be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;did
you notice it said jet black except for
white on its head and neck? Well I&rsquo;ve
come to buy that skunk. What do you
want for him alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he got away, vanished before
we came back from the house after
scrubbing the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the better; might have
got hurt otherwise, eh? He will stay
around here somewhere. Now what
I want you to do is to set some traps
until you catch him. I&rsquo;ve brought the
traps. They&rsquo;re made like boxes, plenty
of room inside. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Catch a live skunk!&rdquo; the Farmer exclaimed
suspiciously. &ldquo;Not I, do it
yourself.&rdquo; Then the thought came to
him that perhaps the man really would
be fool enough to pay money for a
skunk. &ldquo;How much will you give for
him,&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five dollars,&rdquo; was the
prompt reply. The Farmer could
scarcely conceal a gasp of surprise.
Why, his goat wasn&rsquo;t worth that much!
His eyes narrowed;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; he answered craftily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-five, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; croaked the Farmer
again experimentally. The man regarded
him doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;fifty is my
limit. But he&rsquo;s got to be unhurt
and well, do you understand?&rdquo; The
Farmer stood up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch him
for you. Let&rsquo;s see your traps. I&rsquo;ve
had two of mine set for several nights
but haven&rsquo;t caught anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you use for bait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Socks,&rdquo; grunted the Farmer shamefacedly.
&ldquo;He seemed to like them.&rdquo;
The man held back a smile, gave some
instructions and then turned to his boat
for the trip back to the village. He
owned a farm on which he raised skunks
in pens much as a poultryman raised
chickens except that it was the fur of
the skunks which was marketable. The
more black fur there was on a skin, the
more valuable it was, therefore an almost
entirely black skunk like Striped
Coat was worth a good sum to the farm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>While Striped Coat was thus being
sold alive, he was safely sleeping with
his family in the holly tree burrow to
which he had run after discovery by the
boy. A less sensible skunk might have
remained and been killed but Striped
Coat was not one of that kind.</p>
<p>It was on the third night after this,
that he and the others came across the
first of Farmer Slown&rsquo;s new traps.
The family had just come from Goose
Creek, for now that it was time for them
to take care of themselves in the world,
the mother&rsquo;s milk had failed them and
they needed water as well as food.</p>
<p>Wandering along a path made by old
Muskrat in his search for grass roots,
they caught the scent of a freshly killed
chicken and found that it came from a
long box which had an opening at one
end. The mother, nervous as usual,
looked at this with such suspicion that
the others held back too, although much
interested in the smell of this kind of
food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>They kept wandering around the box
sniffing, until all at once the runt of the
family, a pretty black and white little
fellow, could resist it no longer and
slipped in. They crowded about the
entrance when&mdash;bang&mdash;down came a
board with a clatter, nearly smashing
a nose or two and completely shutting
the entrance.</p>
<p>Those on the outside sprang back,
but the runt was caught and could only
add to their alarm by frantic scratching
on the hard wood inside. That was
lesson enough for Striped Coat; he
knew now that a box with a hole was
something dangerous even if it contained
good food.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>In that way the family lost the runt.
Soon afterwards quarreling divided the
remainder, the mother and Striped Coat
staying together and still living in the
holly tree burrow. Sometimes they all
met at night in their hunting, but these
meetings grew less frequent until
Striped Coat and the mother seemed to
have the woods around Farmer Slown&rsquo;s
entirely to themselves.</p>
<p>It was to be sure the time of plenty.
Every rain brought out many kinds of
edible toadstools in the woods, blackberries
hung heavily from their stems,
grasshoppers and crickets had grown
big and fat, white grubs swarmed under
the grass roots around the Farmer&rsquo;s
field. Also there were great green tomato
worms, turtles, frogs, toads and
little snakes, nests of yellow jackets,
bees and other insects. Mice too were
plentiful and unwary.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>So Striped Coat grew amazingly just
as did all the other young woods folk.
At first he grew long and lanky, with
short patchy fur and spindly tail, in
much the same way as a young hawk before
it acquires its full plumage; later
he filled out, his fur becoming thick and
glossy. By the end of August he was
as large as his mother and still growing.
He was wise enough not to be lured
into the Farmer&rsquo;s traps and, like his
mother he now had the right of way
over the other woods animals, being indeed
treated with all the dignity of a
full grown skunk.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic8">
<img src="images/p117.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="687" />
<p class="caption">In much the same way as a young hawk before it acquires
its full plumage</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>More men than the Farmer were
after him however, for the news had
spread that he was worth fifty dollars,
and that sum, walking around as it
were, loose and unclaimed in the woods,
was a decided lure to everyone. Ever
since the great mystery of Farmer
Slown&rsquo;s lost clothes had been cleared up
by the boy&rsquo;s description of Striped Coat,
he had become a marked individual,
spoken of, oddly enough, as Striped
Coat, the black skunk. Whenever
the word skunk was mentioned, people
soon switched the conversation to
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The question to be solved was, where
did he have his den. With that discovered,
the matter of trapping or digging
him out would be a simple one.
The old trappers of the neighborhood
said little but waited patiently for the
coming of late autumn, when the leaves
would no longer be on the bushes. And
every day brought this danger time just
that much nearer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CAPTURED AT LAST</span></h2>
<p>It was in September that Striped
Coat made an important discovery;
travelling further up Goose Creek than
usual, he came across a log cabin, not
the kind ordinarily built by summer visitors
on a good stream for canoeing, but
one which seemed a part of the woods
itself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Instead of being wary about approaching
it, Striped Coat found it
actually luring him. Coming closer,
he found at one end an open door leading
into a room lighted only by the dull
glow from an open fire-place in front of
which stood cozy chairs and a table, objects
which to him seemed to offer good
cover under which to hide if necessary.</p>
<p>For some moments he stood on the
threshold, lured by the smell of food
and by the interesting look of the place,
but undecided whether it was safe to
venture where man had evidently recently
been. Finally, encouraged by
the absolute quiet, he stepped in, warily,
but without any fear, for real fear
such as many animals showed, was something
which he did not seem ever to
have. Wandering silently about the
room, his nostrils dulled by the smoke,
he came directly in front of a man lolling
comfortably in one of the chairs.
The effect was almost electrical. The
man&rsquo;s eyes grew suddenly round and
bulging and he turned a complete backward
somersault, landing on his feet
and then diving through the open window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he yelled when outside.
&ldquo;Mr. Henry, come quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Striped Coat, who had fluffed up in
readiness for anything, moved for the
door, just as another man sprang in and
slammed it behind him. The man
stood absolutely motionless with his
back against the door looking at Striped
Coat who had stopped with tail over his
back and every hair on end waiting for
the slightest further move of this new
enemy. It was a critical moment.
The man won; Striped Coat would not
attack, his weapon was for defense, and
the man did not move even a finger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>So Striped Coat sidled to the other
end of the room to find another outlet.
He did not hurry, he was on his dignity
and knew he was being watched.
Looking up at the open window, which
was out of his reach, he was just in
time to see the top of the first man&rsquo;s
head duck out of sight. Mike had
come back to watch, but knew a skunk
when he saw one and was taking no
chances.</p>
<p>There was no other opening. Striped
Coat was trapped at last.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry, the man at the door
moved quietly to a chair and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;did you ever see
a skunk like that? It&rsquo;s the black one
they&rsquo;re all after. Isn&rsquo;t he a daisy!&rdquo;
The top of Mike&rsquo;s head and one eye
appeared warily over the window sill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all of that,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;the
biggest, prettiest skunk I ever saw!
And he nearly had me, too!&rdquo; Mr.
Henry laughed, then picked a piece of
fish from one of the plates on the table,
and laid it on the floor in front of him.
Soon Striped Coat in circling the room
again, came across this and ate it just
to show he was not afraid. When he
came around again, he found another
piece in the same place and ate that.
It was good fish! Every time he came
to that spot he found a piece, laid there
by Mr. Henry, whom he presently began
to watch with more interest than he
would show an enemy. When this
man moved at all, it was so slowly that
Striped Coat could not take offense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Presently the man stood up, very
quietly moved to the corner of the room
and pulled a huge wood box the distance
of a foot from the wall; behind
this, in the corner, he spread some
clothes and an armful of cotton waste.
Striped Coat could go in and out of this
cozy nest from either side of the box;
it therefore had none of the looks of a
trap. After a little while he tried it,
then tried it again and finally settled
down for a rest in this new bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; came from the awe-struck
Mike. Mr. Henry then arranged
some bedding on one of the sofas
and suggested that Mike also prepare
for a sleep; but that worthy preferred
the boat. The last thing was to place
some more fish and a bowl of water on
the floor and to open the door leading
out to the woods; after that Mr. Henry
went comfortably to sleep on the couch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>Striped Coat, too, actually took a nap,
the warmth being pleasant and the stillness
reassuring. Before the glow of
the fire had entirely died, however, he
walked out and looked all around the
room; finding the door open he moved
out, then returned and ate the fish;
soon afterwards he was again in the
woods but with no unfriendly feeling
towards the Henry cabin. Near the
Creek he came across a likely den under
a stump, and being loggy with all the
food he had eaten, slipped in there for
the day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>This proved a serious blunder, for a
picnic party came up the creek in canoes
and chose that precise spot for luncheon.
One of the men sat on the stump
and amused himself by poking sticks
into the hollow underneath it, finding
to his surprise that something inside
resented this and replied with distinctly
audible stamps of its feet.
Proudly announcing this discovery, he
poked more thoroughly while the others
stood about and excitedly encouraged
him.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a scuffle and out
sprang Striped Coat, at the same time
giving the young man the full benefit
of the musk bath. Amid the confusion
of shrieks from the women and yells
from the men he slipped into the bushes
and ran as he had never run before.
After him came a yelling crowd, gathering
up sticks and trying to head him off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>And still Striped Coat ran, dodging
and threatening his pursuers when
they came too close, but ever getting
nearer to the Henry cabin. At the
open doorway stood Mr. Henry, a pipe
in his mouth; he did not move a muscle
as the wood pussy crossed the little
clearing, eyed him inquiringly and then
slipped by and into his nest behind the
woodbox, with all his old dignity suddenly
returned.</p>
<p>Outside the cabin a howl of joy went
up from the pursuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him now!&rdquo; they shouted.
But Mr. Henry still quietly smoked in
the doorway and eyed them composedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skunk,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;is in
my house. It is safe with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the black skunk! That&rsquo;s
old Striped Coat!&rdquo; shouted one. They
stood about arguing until another of
their number called disgustedly. &ldquo;Ah!
can&rsquo;t you see? He wants all the reward
for himself. Come on back.&rdquo;
Then they trooped away, vowing all
kinds of vengeance; but Mr. Henry
still smoked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>He was however thinking very hard.
Unless he did exactly the right thing he
saw very clearly that this splendid little
animal of the woods would sooner or
latter be killed or captured. The news
of where it had last been seen would
spread only too quickly. Presently
he called in the reluctant Mike and
helped him make a hole in one corner of
the cabin floor to serve as a safer retreat
for Striped Coat who by using it
could go under the cabin itself.</p>
<p>And Striped Coat seemed to understand,
for all that night he could be
heard digging under the floor to make
the place even more cozy and safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WINTER SLEEP</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Henry had taken such a liking
to Striped Coat that he
wanted to make sure the wild wood
pussy would like the cabin well enough
to make it a permanent home. With
this in mind he built an underground
drain leading under it to a pile of
stones nearby. Safety was even more
important than comfort in the matter of
a den, and through this back door
Striped Coat could feel able to go or
come when he chose. The stone pile
hid the entrance and allowed no animal
larger than he, to enter through its
cracks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>It was a fine arrangement and
Striped Coat liked it. He built a big
nest of dry grass, leaves and cotton
waste under the cabin and slept there
instead of in his corner back of the wood
box, but at night he often came out of
the hole in the floor and walked around
the room while Mr. Henry was eating
supper, showing friendliness but in a
dignified, distant way. After eating a
few scraps he would go back to the hole,
then out through the drain to the stone
pile around which he would walk for a
time scenting the air and making very
sure all was well before leaving for the
woods.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic9">
<img src="images/p134.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="717" />
<p class="caption">Under the persimmon and wild apple trees he picked up
ripe fruit, often shaken down by Possum</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>He was growing bigger and finer
every day. By the time the frosts of October
had turned the leaves red, sweetened
the acorns and numbed the big insects
so that they were more easily
caught, his winter coat of fur to keep
him warm in the coming icy weather,
was almost at its full prime, long, almost
like velvet in softness, and black
as coal, yet so glossy that it fairly glittered
in the sunlight. On his head and
neck stood out the pretty white markings
which had given him his name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>His hunts in the woods now were
wonderful picnics. In the grassy spots
he could find big, full grown grasshoppers
and crickets, as well as luscious
white grubs which dry weather had
brought up within an inch or two of the
surface of the ground. Around the
grape-vine tangles, and under the persimmon
and wild apple trees he picked
up ripe fruit often shaken down by
Possum, and under the white oaks,
acorns almost as sweet as chestnuts,
while many other plants, bushes, vines
and trees bore edible things which he
liked, such as tubers, berries or seeds.
He found many mice too in their nests
of grass, and more yellow jacket and
bumble bee combs than he could eat.
No wonder therefore that he was able
to store up a lot of surplus food in the
form of fat, to help him live through the
coming winter when bad weather might
keep him from finding more food for
weeks at a time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>It is well that Autumn is a time of
plenty, for in the North it enables the
animals and even some birds which do
not migrate to the warm South, to gather
much more food than they need at the
moment. When the cold winds blow
and the ground is frozen it is badly
needed. Red Squirrel hid nuts in
forks of limbs and in hollows and crevices,
Grey Squirrel buried a supply in
good safe places, Ground Hackie made
a granary for himself underground, the
foxes buried things like dead mice,
pieces of rabbit, frogs, snakes, fish and
even apples, but creatures like Bear,
Woodchuck, Possum, Coon and Striped
Coat just stored, in layers of rich
fat around their body, enough nourishment
to carry them through the hard
months, until warm, pleasant days came.
Those that were not wise enough to
gather a supply in some form, had a terrible
time and often died before spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>As Mr. Henry kept open house at the
cabin every Sunday, it was usual for at
least one canoe party of his family and
friends to come for luncheon and a walk
around the interesting woods. But
more interesting to them than anything
else was an occasional glimpse of
Striped Coat, who though usually sleeping
in the day time was waked up by
the new voices and often induced to
come out for a dainty piece of meat or
fish. The friendliness of this beautiful
and entirely free creature of the
woods delighted many a visitor.</p>
<p>When really cold weather set in, Mr.
Henry prepared to leave the cabin until
Spring, so he anxiously watched Striped
Coat in the hope that before leaving
time came, the wood pussy would hibernate,
that is to say, go to sleep for the
winter in the safe, warm nest. His
fat would feed him while he slept, for
without exercise he would not need
much nourishment. The woods were
well sprinkled with traps and a snow
for tracking might come at any time
and help Farmer Slown or other woodsman
to locate his den and set the
traps more dangerously unless he was
guarded.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic10">

<p class="caption">The friendliness of this beautiful and entirely free creature of the woods delighted

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>At length a very cold day came and
Striped Coat could be heard remodeling
his nest and digging energetically.
Mr. Henry watched for him and was
surprised once or twice to see the head
of an entirely strange wood pussy
thrust out of the hole in the floor as it
looked around. What it was hunting
for, was soon shown by Striped Coat
who presently came out and began
dragging at the rug as if to carry it
away with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! so that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; thought the
watcher, &ldquo;you have brought in a friend
to stay with you and need more covers
to make him comfortable. Well, you
shall have them!&rdquo; And as often as
Striped Coat came up, he was handed a
ball of cotton waste. Soon he appeared
no more and all was quiet except for the
sighing of the north wind outside.
Striped Coat had gone comfortably to
sleep, and with him, as in the days when
he was little, was his mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SPRING AWAKENING</span></h2>
<p>December and January passed
without Striped Coat waking up
for more than an occasional peep at the
woods whenever the warm south wind
was blowing; but the last days of February
found him uneasy and on the
watch for good weather; then there
came a gentle warm rain which brought
a new scent into the woods&mdash;the scent
of Spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Striped Coat caught it and was lured
out as soon as darkness came; his mother
followed eagerly. They were both
anxious to get food but also interested
in looking around and hunting up the
old places which they had frequented in
the summer. The mother travelled to
the deserted woodchuck burrow under
the holly tree, and finding it pleasantly
dry and homelike, rearranged the nest
and slept there instead of returning to
the cabin.</p>
<p>Striped Coat however went further;
he made a great circle through the
woods which carried him far beyond
Farmer Slown&rsquo;s field to a sandy hill
where, because the ground was dryer
and warmer than below, many animals
had their winter dens and where therefore
it was not as lonely as nearer the
Creek. Here he found the trails of Possum
and of Coon and even of Gray Fox,
but of none of his own kind. Wherever
he went he saw others of the woods
folk, all hungry, all in a hurry and none
interested in him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>That day he spent in a hollow log
far in the pines. It was an uncomfortable
place, so he left it early on the
following night and restlessly resumed
his trip through the dripping, scented
woods, on and on with scarcely a stop
for rest. The long sleep had left him
lonely, he knew that somewhere were
companions, and he would keep on going
until he found them.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the food of the last year
had already been gathered by the woods
creatures and the new year&rsquo;s food had
not begun to grow, but here and there
he picked up something to stave off
hunger&mdash;a half awakened insect or two,
a dead shrew, scattered acorns and some
grass bulbs. Here and there, too, he
found good dens and spent more than
one day in comfortably sleeping in
them, only to start out again at dusk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>His seemed now almost a hopeless
task, due to the success of trappers and
especially to Farmer Slown&rsquo;s relentless
work against the wood pussies; yet
still he searched.</p>
<p>At length his circle brought him back
to the Goose Creek country where he
knew the trails and felt a longing once
more to sleep safely in his home under
the cabin. For ten nights he had been
travelling, and now disheartened, footsore
and thin, he was back where he
started, after finding the world a
lonely place. But here would at least
be his mother, or was she too gone now
and he left, the last of the wood pussies
on Goose Creek?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Ahead loomed the cabin. Striped
Coat, dragging himself gloomily through
the bushes scarcely looked at it until,
near the stone pile, he caught on a
breath of wind an unfamiliar scent&mdash;very
faint, very elusive but at the
same time unmistakably telling him
that a strange wood pussy had been
there.</p>
<p>In an instant it reawakened his interest
in life and made of him a different
looking creature. Again he was alert,
quick footed, eager. Again his wonderful
fur fluffed up, until his body looked
like a perfect muff.</p>
<p>Cautiously, he entered the drain, following
the elusive scent which led under
the cabin and showed that in his
absence the other wood pussy had actually
slept in his cozy nest. Now the
den was empty, he had come back too
late.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Striped Coat moved about, noting all
the places where the other had walked
also. Little changes had been made
here and there&mdash;a burrow started, some
earth moved away from the nest and
the nest itself made smaller as if to fit
around a smaller body. Presently he
came again to the drain and started out,
determined to go in search of this other,
where he did not know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>And then he noticed the scent more
strongly, and coming out of the stone
pile found it stronger still, as if the
other had been there only a moment before.
Searching this way and that he
picked up the trail and followed it into
the woods. Had the other come back
to the cabin and, finding the rightful
owner in possession tried to escape unobserved?
But how escape Striped
Coat, whose nose was as keen as a knife
blade was sharp; Striped Coat, the
fame of whose fur had travelled over
a whole country and who yet lived;
Striped Coat who could travel a whole
night without growing tired; Striped
Coat who was lonely!</p>
<p>And did the other really wish very
much to escape? Was not she too
lonely? If not, why should she have
gone so slowly into the woods as to be
scarcely out of sight of the cabin when
Striped Coat came rushing along her
trail. Pretty little wood pussy! Was
not she as thrilled as he at this meeting
and timidly anxious to make friends?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>And yet she pretended with all her
might that she did not care the least bit
about him and wanted to continue her
lonely way, and only when Striped Coat
seemed on the point of turning back
would she look around and hesitate and
lead him on again. And somehow it
happened that instead of going further
into the big woods, they made a circle
which brought them back to the cabin.
Side by side they neared the entrance,
and just as the sun lit up the sky in the
East they vanished that way into the
stone pile, and Striped Coat had found
a companion.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic11">

<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">RAISING A FAMILY</span></h2>
<p>When the early pink and white
flowers of the trailing arbutus
brightened the ground in many parts of
the slowly awakening woods, Mr. Henry
returned to the cabin. It was there that
he found it possible to do his best work,
for he was a writer, who needed the
quiet and solitude of a place like this.
Nothing really unpleasant ever seemed
to happen there, and interesting things
were always cropping up. For instance
there was Striped Coat! And now
Striped Coat had a mate!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>But the other little wood pussy did
not like the noise of footsteps on the
floor over her head. They frightened
her. So after two days of nervous
watchfulness, she could bear it no longer
and slipped out under cover of the twilight,
picking her way into the woods
until she reached an uprooted pine
under whose trunk a large woodchuck
had dug a burrow. This old fellow
had only recently awakened from his
winter sleep and was at that moment
in his snug nest, dreaming no doubt of
the time when the woods would again
be full of eatable green things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>It could not be said therefore that
he was overjoyed when he heard
scratching at his front door and caught
the scent of the wood pussy as she descended
towards him. Knowing from
experience that to steal a burrow like
this was a great temptation to the meat
eaters who needed dens for themselves,
he at once began to make unpleasant
remarks in woodchuck language and to
threaten with his teeth, the longest of
which being arranged like a rat&rsquo;s in the
front of his mouth, could give a fearful
bite.</p>
<p>But the wood pussy had come there
because she already knew that this burrow
was just the right size for her, a
smaller woodchuck&rsquo;s home would not
have been comfortable. Moreover an
old woodchuck&rsquo;s den was usually well
hidden and made with plenty of protection
against rain and dampness as well
as with a second entrance for escape in
case of danger. It would not be an
easy matter to drive out the old fighter
who was quite as large as herself, but
her need was urgent and this burrow
suited her exactly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Showing her teeth and threatening
with the musk bath made no difference
however to this woodchuck, indeed he
worked himself into such a rage that he
even drove her back inch by inch until
he had her almost at the entrance again.
This fighting spirit however proved his
undoing, for suddenly he was attacked
from the rear and with a force which
there was no resisting. Striped Coat
had followed the trail of his companion
and, finding her fighting in the burrow,
had run in too and tried to push past in
order to help. The burrow being much
too narrow for this, he had then rushed
out of that entrance and in at the back
door so quickly that he was able to surprise
the old chuck before he could return
to his usual fighting position in
a corner with back protected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Now, there was nothing for him to
do but get out of his burrow as quickly
as he could and go somewhere else where
he might hope to have a little peace before
being found again and driven out
by some den hunter. It sounded like a
hard life, but Ground Hog&rsquo;s claws and
feet were so powerful that in soft earth
he could dig a fairly good den in a day.
He was lucky this time, for had it been
a fox instead of a wood pussy, he would
surely have been eaten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>And so with Striped Coat still living
under the cabin, his mate got a fine den
all to herself, which came in handy a
few weeks later when six little ones arrived,
three of them like the mother and
three with the dark body and the markings
of Striped Coat, their father, already
showing in their skin. Healthy
little things they were too, with plenty
of appetite which their mother was usually
able to supply, for almost her
only thought now was of these helpless,
hairless little youngsters.</p>
<p>She had carried into the den and
stored away conveniently, several half
eaten mice, lizards and little snakes
which, for a day or two, made it unnecessary
for her to do much hunting, but on
the fourth day she felt very hungry and
wandered all the way to Farmer Slown&rsquo;s
field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Striped Coat, coming across her trail,
followed her there and arrived at almost
the same moment, so together they
explored the edge of the field for beetles
and at length reached the barn under
which Striped Coat slipped, as in the
old days; but now things were changed,
there were vile odors and diggings of
rats on all sides.</p>
<p>Even as they entered, a huge male rat
ran past them and sulkily entered a burrow.
Striped Coat turned towards him,
but not as quickly as his mate who
dashed after the flying tail. She was
still ravenously hungry and here was
meat.</p>
<p>The rat however was now in his narrow
den, feeling quite safe enough to
turn and chatter furiously at his pursuers
who accepted his challenge by beginning
to dig. The burrow ran close
to the surface of the ground, so they
made the dirt fairly fly and took short
cuts by skipping over some sections.
This was the kind of work they were
built for and the eagerness of his mate
had now thoroughly aroused Striped
Coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>From one hole to another they chased
the clever rat until it seemed as if at
any moment they would have him cornered
and force him to fight, but he
knew what he was about and kept one
thing in reserve, a dash to Farmer
Slown&rsquo;s own house, under which he had
a hole leading into the kitchen. He
reckoned however without the experienced
wisdom of Striped Coat.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic12">
<img src="images/p162.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="500" />
<p class="caption">The three tugging, biting, squealing and pulling each other this way and that until
they burst from under the barn and had it out on the flat ground</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>When what seemed to him the right
moment had come, the rat poked his
battle scarred gray nose out of the hidden
hole, saw that the way seemed
clear and made a rush, but Striped Coat
had been waiting for just this move and
made a rush too. He and the rat
bumped into each other amid furious
squeals, and the rat was thrown off his
feet. In that moment the other wood
pussy reached him and landed on top
with both front paws and all her weight,
but without so much as knocking the
breath out of the powerful, big fellow
who rolled over and would have escaped
had not Striped Coat caught him suddenly
by the skin on the back of his
head.</p>
<p>Then the fight became furious. The
three tugging, biting, squealing and
pulling each other this way and that
until they burst from under the barn
and had it out on the flat ground directly
in front of the Farmer&rsquo;s house.
Here the moon shone on the battle and
helped the mother wood pussy to see
her chance to get the death grip on the
rat&rsquo;s thick neck and finish him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>They did not hear a window open
over their heads nor see the Farmer&rsquo;s
face appear; in the heat of the fighting
they had forgotten all else. But now
Striped Coat, who still had his grip on
the rat&rsquo;s head, began to drag him under
the fence and then to the bushes and
then to a dark thicket where they
seemed safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Striped Coat lay down to lick a badly
bitten paw and to free his wonderful
fur from dirt, which he did by carefully
shaking, scratching and much work with
his mouth. But his mate began at the
left hind leg of the rat and ate as long
as she could find anything tender
enough to chew. It was not as tasty a
meal as she would have liked, but it all
went to keep her strong and so to help
the six little ones to get all the milk
they needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MASTER OF THE WOODS</span></h2>
<p>It was early morning. Under the
cabin, Striped Coat was in his big
bed curled up asleep but twitching occasionally
as he dreamed of battles with
old warrior rats. In the woodchuck&rsquo;s
burrow under the uprooted pine, Striped
Coat&rsquo;s mate was giving all the little
&ldquo;striped coats&rdquo; their morning bath, using
her wet tongue as the wash rag.
And in the old den under the holly tree
Striped Coat&rsquo;s mother was doing much
the same with four little ones which
made up her new family; pretty youngsters,
but all showing signs of having
as much white as black in their markings,
when they grew up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Over their heads the woods was now
a mass of green. Birds were singing,
bees were buzzing around numberless
flowers, far and wide there was the hum
of the insect army now come again to
feed on the plant life. How this army
would spread and grow and ravage the
land, if birds by day were not constantly
after it on the ground, in the trees and
in the air, and if at night its ranks were
not attacked by the active little shrews,
the swift flying bat, and the wood pussies,
not to mention other woodsfolk
like the fox, the mole, old Possum and
even Screech Owl, who all helped! In
the water the fish did their part. Yes,
everything must eat to live.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>And the farmers were cultivating
their crops and raising chickens and
other live stock, for man too must eat;
and they were fighting everywhere the
insects and the other vermin which
would like to take all these things for
themselves. One of these farmers was
Ben Slown of Goose Creek. Upon him
on this beautiful morning Mr. Henry
made a call.</p>
<p>It was not very formal; the Farmer
sat on his cultivator in the field and Mr.
Henry leaned against the fence nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s life at the cabin?&rdquo;
asked the Farmer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting. The wild creatures
are growing tame again. They are
around or in my cabin most of the day
and night; it&rsquo;s on account of them that
I came to see you; I wondered whether
you and I, working together, couldn&rsquo;t
stop the trapping that&rsquo;s going on around
here. Woods animals that do a lot of
good are being killed off; there are the
skunks for example, only a few old
ones are left. Can&rsquo;t we save them?
What do you say?&rdquo; Mr. Henry spoke
seriously and the Farmer listened
equally so. Once he looked up rather
sharply, as if wondering how much the
other man suspected the part he had
taken in trapping during the autumn
and winter, but he did not interrupt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about those
skunks, Mr. Henry,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I
know you kept a watchful eye over the
black one last autumn and I&rsquo;m kind of
glad of it now. All last year I saw their
tracks over my field. I calculated
they&rsquo;d eat every vegetable and ear of
corn I raised, and yet somehow I never
had a better crop anywhere.
I&rsquo;ll admit it. No cutworms,
no grubs, none of those big
brown beetles, even no mice
to speak of.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic13">
<img src="images/p170.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="801" />
<p class="caption">Skunk tracks.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know just what
was doing the good work until
I&mdash;that is, the trappers&mdash;caught
off the skunks last
autumn. I can tell you that
after that the mice and rats
nearly ate me up. Well, I
still hadn&rsquo;t studied it out
when the other night I saw
the queerest thing ever!
Two skunks killing a sewer
rat almost on my doorstep,
and it an old fellow half as
big as one of them. Such
squealing you never heard, I
guess! That big black skunk of yours
was the one that did the trick; he
wouldn&rsquo;t let go, the other one just
helped finish things. I tell you it was a
real fight!&rdquo; Farmer Slown chuckled at
the recollection.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic14">
<img src="images/p172.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="686" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;That big black skunk of yours was the one that did the
trick&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;That rat,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;had done
a heap of damage already, gnawing and
digging and carrying off little chickens;
and neither I nor that dog of mine
could ever get a hold of him. I have
a feeling that the skunks take an egg
whenever it&rsquo;s left lying around, but
they never come into my hen house like
that rat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a farmer and haven&rsquo;t time to fool
with wild animals the way you can, but
I like to have people like you around to
buy things I raise and I have a change
of feeling about those skunks. I&rsquo;m all
for them since that rat business. Yes
sir! And what&rsquo;s more you needn&rsquo;t
worry about traps any longer.&rdquo; Having
said which Farmer Slown stood up to
resume work as if the matter were now
ended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Mr. Henry, however, jumped the
fence to give his hand a hearty shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll be neighbors a long
time!&rdquo; he cried. As he strode back
through the woods, the Farmer looked
after him for a moment or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Who would
have thought I would ever find that
neighbors and skunks were any good!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>That night Striped Coat took a long
trip. He wandered far below the Farmer&rsquo;s
field and then to the sandy hill
in the pines and lastly along the bank of
Goose Creek. He met Mink and Coon
and old Possum, Gray Fox, Brown
Weasel, Bun and the deer from Cranberry
Swamp. All looked at him and
then gave him the path. Yes, there
were many animals, but after all this
was his range and he was master of them
all.</p>
<p>Standing once more in front of the
stone pile he shook himself until his
fur stood out all over him, that fur
for which any dealer would give a big
price. Some day his children, and perhaps
later his children&rsquo;s children, with
black fur like his, would wander at
night through the woods of Goose Creek
chasing the elusive mice and beetles;
but he was the first of the new order, he
was Striped Coat, the Black Skunk!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>As he stood there, a pale light spread
over the sky, the protecting black shadows
grew fainter. He knew that he, a
creature of the night, must now bid farewell
for a while to all the outside world.
Reluctantly, he bowed his head and entered
the low arch of the stone pile.
Slowly his body moved out of sight, then
the long tail until not even the tip remained
in view.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
